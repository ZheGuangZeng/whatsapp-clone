# PRD: TDD Refactor

## Executive Summary

Transform the WhatsApp clone project from its current broken state (85 compilation errors, 15% test coverage) into a high-quality, maintainable codebase with 0 errors and 80%+ test coverage using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology and Clean Architecture principles.

### Value Proposition
- **Developer Productivity**: Stable codebase reduces debug time by 70%
- **Maintenance Cost**: High test coverage prevents regression issues
- **Feature Velocity**: Clean Architecture enables 50% faster feature development
- **Code Quality**: TDD ensures every line of code provides value

## Problem Statement

### What Problem Are We Solving?
The WhatsApp clone project is currently in a broken state with:
- 85 compilation errors preventing successful builds
- Only 15% test coverage leaving 85% of code untested
- Broken modules (chat, meetings, file_storage) moved to .backup/
- Technical debt blocking new feature development

### Why Is This Important Now?
- **Blocking Development**: Cannot add new features with current error count
- **Risk of Regressions**: Low test coverage means changes break existing functionality
- **Developer Frustration**: Broken build process slows down team velocity
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulating architecture violations increase maintenance cost
