# Task: Chat Domain TDD

## Overview
Build the complete domain layer for Chat module using TDD methodology, including entities, use cases, and repository interfaces.

## Context
Chat module was moved to .backup/ due to compilation errors. Rebuild from scratch using proven TDD approach similar to the successful messaging system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete domain entities with comprehensive tests
- [ ] All use cases implemented with TDD
- [ ] Repository interfaces defined and mocked
- [ ] 25+ test cases covering domain logic
- [ ] 100% test coverage for domain layer

## Technical Approach

### TDD Red Phase (Morning)
**Entities Tests**:
- Room entity: creation, validation, state transitions
- Message entity: content validation, timestamps, status
- Participant entity: permissions, roles, activity status
- MessageThread entity: threading logic, reply chains

**Repository Interface Tests**:
- IChatRepository: CRUD operations, query patterns
- IMessageRepository: real-time operations, history management  
- IRoomRepository: room lifecycle, participant management

### TDD Green Phase (Afternoon)
**Entity Implementation**:
- Room with validation rules and business logic
- Enhanced Message entity building on existing foundation
- Participant with role-based permissions
- MessageThread with reply and thread management

**Use Cases Implementation**:
- SendMessageUseCase: validation, persistence, real-time dispatch
- GetMessagesUseCase: pagination, filtering, caching
- CreateRoomUseCase: room creation with participants
- JoinRoomUseCase: permission validation, participant addition

### TDD Refactor Phase
- Remove duplication between entities
- Optimize validation logic
- Ensure SOLID principles compliance
- Performance optimization for large chat histories

## Success Metrics
- Domain entities: 4 complete with full validation
- Use cases: 8 implemented with error handling
- Repository interfaces: 3 with complete contracts
- Test cases: 25+ covering all scenarios
- Code coverage: 100% for domain layer

## Dependencies
- Auth module completion (for user context)
- Core Result pattern infrastructure
- Messaging system as reference implementation
- Clean Architecture patterns established

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All domain entities implemented with validation
- [ ] All use cases implemented with error handling
- [ ] Repository interfaces fully defined
- [ ] Mock implementations for testing
- [ ] 100% test coverage achieved
- [ ] All tests pass with meaningful assertions
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Domain logic documented

## Estimated Effort: 8 hours (1 day)
- Entity TDD: 3 hours
- Use case TDD: 3 hours  
- Repository design: 2 hoursupdated: 2025-09-06T15:03:06Z
