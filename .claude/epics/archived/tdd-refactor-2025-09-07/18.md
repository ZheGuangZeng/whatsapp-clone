# Task: FileStorage TDD

## Overview
Rebuild complete FileStorage module using TDD methodology, including file upload/download, Supabase Storage integration, and file management UI.

## Context
FileStorage module was moved to .backup/ due to compilation errors. Rebuild with TDD approach focusing on file management, storage integration, and user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete file domain models with validation
- [ ] Supabase Storage integration working
- [ ] File upload/download functionality complete
- [ ] File management UI rebuilt
- [ ] 40+ test cases covering all scenarios

## Technical Approach

### Day 1: File Domain TDD
**Entity Design**:
- FileEntity: metadata, validation, lifecycle states
- UploadProgress: real-time progress tracking
- FilePermission: access control and sharing
- FileCategory: organization and filtering

**Use Cases**:
- UploadFileUseCase: validation, progress tracking, storage
- DownloadFileUseCase: retrieval, caching, permissions
- DeleteFileUseCase: cleanup, permission validation
- GetFileUrlUseCase: secure URL generation with expiry

### Day 2: Storage Integration TDD
**Service Abstraction**:
- IFileStorageService interface for all operations
- SupabaseStorageImpl with actual API integration
- File type validation and size limits
- Storage quota management and monitoring

**Data Layer**:
- FileModel with JSON serialization
- FileRepository implementation with caching
- Local file cache management
- Upload queue for offline support

### Day 3: UI and Complete Testing
**File Management UI**:
- FilePickerWidget rebuilt from existing broken component
- FileUploadProgress with real-time updates
- FileListView with filtering and sorting
- FilePreview for supported file types

**Integration Testing**:
- End-to-end file upload flow
- Large file handling and progress
- Concurrent upload scenarios
- Error recovery and retry logic

## Success Metrics
- Domain entities: 4 complete with validation
- Storage service: Full Supabase integration
- UI components: 6 rebuilt and functional
- Test cases: 40+ covering all scenarios
- File operations: Upload, download, delete all working

## Dependencies
- Auth module completion (for user context)
- Supabase Storage configuration
- File system permissions on devices
- Network connectivity for storage operations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All file entities implemented with validation
- [ ] Supabase Storage integration complete
- [ ] File upload/download working reliably
- [ ] File management UI functional
- [ ] Progress tracking and error handling complete
- [ ] Large file support verified
- [ ] Security and permissions working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Estimated Effort: 24 hours (3 days)
- Domain models: 8 hours
- Storage integration: 8 hours
- UI and testing: 8 hoursupdated: 2025-09-06T15:03:06Z
