# Task: Chat Complete Implementation

## Overview
Complete the Chat module implementation with data layer (Supabase integration), presentation layer (UI components), and comprehensive integration testing.

## Context  
Building upon the domain layer foundation, implement the full chat functionality with real-time messaging, UI components, and end-to-end testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete data layer with Supabase integration
- [ ] Real-time message synchronization working
- [ ] UI components rebuilt and integrated
- [ ] 80+ test cases covering all layers
- [ ] End-to-end chat functionality verified

## Technical Approach

### Day 1: Data Layer TDD
**Models and Serialization**:
- MessageModel with JSON serialization/deserialization
- RoomModel with participant management
- ParticipantModel with role and status tracking
- Type conversion tests between domain and data models

**Data Sources**:
- ChatRemoteSource: Supabase Realtime integration
- MessageLocalSource: Local caching and offline support
- Repository implementations with error handling and retry logic

### Day 2: Real-time Integration  
**Supabase Realtime**:
- Message broadcasting and receiving
- Room participant updates
- Connection management and reconnection logic
- Offline queue and sync when reconnected

**State Management**:
- ChatNotifier with Riverpod integration
- Message state synchronization
- Room state management
- Error state handling and user feedback

### Day 3: Presentation Layer
**UI Components**:
- ChatRoomPage rebuilt from scratch
- MessageBubble components with status indicators
- MessageInput with validation and sending states  
- ParticipantList with real-time updates

**Integration Testing**:
- End-to-end message sending flow
- Real-time message receiving
- Error scenario testing (network failures, API errors)
- Performance testing with message history

## Success Metrics
- Data models: 4 complete with serialization
- Repository implementations: 3 with full CRUD
- UI components: 6 rebuilt with tests
- Test cases: 80+ covering all scenarios
- Integration tests: 10+ end-to-end flows

## Dependencies
- Chat domain layer completed
- Supabase configuration stable
- UI design patterns from existing components
- Riverpod state management patterns

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All data models implemented with JSON handling
- [ ] Repository pattern fully implemented
- [ ] Real-time messaging functional
- [ ] All UI components rebuilt and tested
- [ ] Integration tests covering critical paths
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code review approved

## Estimated Effort: 24 hours (3 days)
- Data layer: 8 hours
- Real-time integration: 8 hours
- UI and testing: 8 hoursupdated: 2025-09-06T15:03:06Z
