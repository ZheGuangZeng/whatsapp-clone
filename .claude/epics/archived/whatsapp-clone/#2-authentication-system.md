# Task: Authentication & User Management System

## Description
Implement complete user authentication system using Supabase Auth with phone/email registration, profile management, and JWT-based session handling. This forms the foundation for all subsequent features requiring user identification and authorization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Phone number and email registration flows implemented
- [ ] SMS/email verification working for account activation
- [ ] JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- [ ] User profile management (avatar, display name, status)
- [ ] Password reset and account recovery functionality
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured in Supabase
- [ ] Authentication state management with Riverpod providers
- [ ] Offline authentication state persistence
- [ ] Unit tests covering 80%+ of authentication logic
- [ ] Integration tests for complete registration/login flows

## Technical Approach
- Use Supabase Auth SDK for Flutter with custom UI
- Implement Riverpod providers for authentication state management
- Create secure storage for tokens using flutter_secure_storage
- Design clean architecture with authentication repository pattern
- Configure PostgreSQL RLS policies for data isolation
- Implement automatic token refresh with network retry logic

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for authentication repository and providers
- Widget tests for login/registration UI components
- Integration tests for complete authentication flows
- Error handling tests for network failures and invalid credentials
- Security tests for token handling and storage

## Dependencies
- Supabase project setup and configuration
- Flutter development environment
- SMS/email service configuration (Supabase built-in)
