# Task: Advanced Meeting Features

## Description
Implement enterprise-grade meeting features including cloud recording, breakout rooms, screen sharing, and collaborative whiteboard. These advanced features differentiate the platform from basic video calling solutions and support professional use cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cloud recording with automated start/stop and storage
- [ ] Recording playback interface with download capabilities
- [ ] Breakout room creation and participant assignment
- [ ] Dynamic participant migration between rooms
- [ ] Screen sharing with application window selection
- [ ] Desktop sharing with quality control options
- [ ] Collaborative whiteboard with real-time synchronization
- [ ] Whiteboard drawing tools (pen, shapes, text, eraser)
- [ ] Interactive meeting features (raise hand, Q&A queue)
- [ ] Emoji reactions during meetings
- [ ] Meeting transcription and closed captions
- [ ] Recording file management and cleanup automation
- [ ] Comprehensive testing for all advanced features
- [ ] Performance optimization for resource-intensive features

## Technical Approach
- Implement LiveKit recording pipeline with cloud storage
- Create breakout room management with sub-room architecture
- Integrate screen sharing with platform-specific capture APIs
- Develop collaborative whiteboard with vector synchronization
- Design interactive meeting controls with real-time state updates
- Use efficient WebSocket communication for whiteboard collaboration

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for recording and breakout room logic
- Integration tests for screen sharing functionality
- Performance tests for whiteboard synchronization
- Stress tests for multiple breakout rooms
- Widget tests for advanced meeting UI components
- End-to-end tests for complete meeting scenarios

## Dependencies
- LiveKit meeting integration (Task 4)
- Cloud storage configuration for recordings
- Screen capture permissions and APIs
- WebSocket infrastructure for whiteboard sync
