# Task: LiveKit Meeting Integration

## Description
Integrate LiveKit for large-scale video conferencing supporting 50-100 participants with high-quality audio/video, participant management, and meeting controls. This is the core differentiator requiring enterprise-grade meeting functionality within a consumer messaging app.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] LiveKit SDK integration with Flutter application
- [ ] Video/audio calling for 2-100 participants
- [ ] Dynamic video grid layout for multiple participants
- [ ] Meeting room creation and management
- [ ] Host permissions and participant controls
- [ ] Mute/unmute audio and video controls
- [ ] Participant admission and removal
- [ ] Meeting invitation and scheduling system
- [ ] Join performance <5 seconds from invitation to connection
- [ ] Audio/video latency <150ms for optimal experience
- [ ] Connection quality monitoring and adaptation
- [ ] Meeting state persistence in database
- [ ] Comprehensive testing for various meeting sizes
- [ ] Load testing for 100 concurrent participants

## Technical Approach
- Integrate LiveKit Flutter SDK with custom UI components
- Implement meeting room management with PostgreSQL persistence
- Create adaptive video grid layout with performance optimization
- Design meeting invitation system with calendar integration
- Implement connection quality monitoring with fallback strategies
- Use Riverpod providers for meeting state management

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for meeting management logic
- Integration tests for LiveKit connection flows
- Performance tests for large meeting scenarios (50-100 participants)
- Network condition tests with simulated poor connectivity
- Widget tests for meeting UI components
- Stress tests for concurrent meeting rooms

## Dependencies
- Authentication system (Task 1)
- Messaging engine for meeting invitations (Task 2)
- LiveKit server deployment and configuration
- WebRTC compatibility verification
