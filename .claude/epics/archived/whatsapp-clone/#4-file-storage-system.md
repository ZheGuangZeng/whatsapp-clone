# Task: File Storage & Sharing System

## Description
Implement comprehensive file storage and sharing system supporting images, documents, voice messages, and video files up to 100MB. Includes automatic compression, thumbnail generation, CDN integration, and tiered storage for cost optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Image upload with automatic compression and format conversion
- [ ] Document file sharing (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.) with previews
- [ ] Voice message recording and playback functionality
- [ ] Video file sharing with thumbnail generation
- [ ] Progressive upload with background processing
- [ ] 100MB file size limit enforcement
- [ ] CDN integration for global file delivery
- [ ] Tiered storage implementation (hot/cold storage)
- [ ] File metadata management and indexing
- [ ] Temporary file cleanup automation
- [ ] Upload progress tracking and cancellation
- [ ] File sharing permissions and access control
- [ ] Comprehensive testing for all file types
- [ ] Performance optimization for large file handling

## Technical Approach
- Use Supabase Storage with custom bucket policies
- Implement file compression and thumbnail generation services
- Create progressive upload with resumable functionality
- Design CDN integration with Asia-Pacific optimization
- Implement tiered storage with lifecycle policies
- Use Flutter image and video processing packages

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for file processing and storage logic
- Integration tests for upload/download flows
- Performance tests for large file handling
- Security tests for file access permissions
- Error handling tests for upload failures
- Widget tests for file sharing UI components

## Dependencies
- Authentication system (Task 1)
- Messaging engine for file sharing integration (Task 2)
- CDN service configuration
- Cloud storage provider setup
