# Task 4: Production Infrastructure

## Overview
Deploy secure, scalable production infrastructure across Singapore and Japan regions with proper SSL/TLS configuration, environment-specific secrets management, database migration strategy, and comprehensive security hardening.

## Context
Currently only development infrastructure exists. Production deployment requires multi-region setup for low latency access, proper security hardening, SSL certificate management, and environment separation to meet enterprise-grade requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-region deployment active in Singapore and Japan
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates properly configured and automated renewal
- [ ] Production environment variables and secrets securely managed
- [ ] Database production migration completed with backup strategy
- [ ] Security hardening implemented (DDoS protection, rate limiting)
- [ ] Environment separation (dev/staging/prod) properly configured
- [ ] DNS routing and subdomain configuration operational
- [ ] Automated backup and disaster recovery procedures active

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning
- **Region Selection**: Primary in Singapore, secondary in Japan for redundancy
- **Resource Planning**: CPU, memory, and storage requirements based on user projections
- **Network Configuration**: VPC setup, subnets, and security group configuration
- **Load Balancer Setup**: Geographic traffic distribution and health checking
- **CDN Integration**: Content delivery optimization for static assets

### Phase 2: SSL/TLS and Domain Management
- **Domain Acquisition**: Production domain registration and DNS configuration
- **Certificate Management**: Automated SSL certificate provisioning and renewal
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Force HTTPS for all connections with proper redirects
- **Certificate Pinning**: Mobile app certificate pinning for enhanced security
- **Subdomain Strategy**: API, admin, and monitoring subdomain configuration

### Phase 3: Environment and Secrets Management
- **Environment Separation**: Distinct dev, staging, and production environments
- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage and rotation of API keys, database credentials
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configuration without code changes
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for different environments
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all configuration changes

### Phase 4: Database Production Setup
- **Production Migration**: Safe migration of database schema and data
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Performance Tuning**: Database optimization for production workloads
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Monitoring Setup**: Database performance and health monitoring

### Phase 5: Security Hardening
- **DDoS Protection**: Implement DDoS protection and rate limiting
- **Firewall Configuration**: Restrictive firewall rules and IP whitelisting
- **Intrusion Detection**: Automated intrusion detection and response
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security vulnerability assessments
- **Security Headers**: Implement proper security headers and policies

## Infrastructure Architecture

### Multi-Region Deployment
```
Primary Region (Singapore):
├── Application Servers (Auto-scaling group)
├── Database (Primary with read replicas)
├── Load Balancer (Application Load Balancer)
├── CDN Distribution (CloudFront/equivalent)
└── Monitoring and Logging

Secondary Region (Japan):
├── Application Servers (Standby/active)
├── Database (Read replica/failover)
├── Load Balancer (Health check routing)
└── Disaster Recovery Resources
```

### Security Layers
```
Internet → CDN → WAF → Load Balancer → Application Servers → Database
         ↓
    DDoS Protection → Rate Limiting → SSL Termination → Security Headers
```

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables
- **Database Connections**: Production database URLs and credentials
- **API Keys**: Supabase production keys, LiveKit production tokens
- **Third-party Services**: Analytics, monitoring, and notification service keys
- **Feature Flags**: Production-specific feature configuration
- **Performance Tuning**: Production-optimized timeout and connection settings

### Secrets Management Strategy
- **Encryption at Rest**: All secrets encrypted using industry-standard encryption
- **Access Control**: Strict access control with audit trails
- **Rotation Schedule**: Regular rotation of all sensitive credentials
- **Emergency Access**: Secure emergency access procedures for critical situations
- **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA compliance for data protection

## Security Hardening Measures

### Network Security
- **WAF Implementation**: Web Application Firewall with custom rules
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS
- **IP Filtering**: Geographic IP filtering and suspicious IP blocking
- **Network Segmentation**: Proper network segmentation between services

### Application Security
- **API Security**: OAuth 2.0, JWT token management, and API versioning
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
