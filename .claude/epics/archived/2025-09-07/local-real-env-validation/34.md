# Task: Create Comprehensive Test Data and Validation

## Description
Create realistic test data seed scripts and comprehensive end-to-end validation testing to ensure complete feature parity between local real environment and production environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test data seed scripts for users, chats, messages
- [ ] Meeting room and participant test data
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests for all features
- [ ] Performance validation matching success criteria
- [ ] Comparison testing between Mock and real services
- [ ] Automated validation script for complete environment
- [ ] Data reset/refresh capabilities for testing

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Create SQL seed scripts for realistic test data
- Implement automated testing suite covering all user flows
- Add performance monitoring and validation
- Create environment comparison tests

**Key considerations:**
- Test data representing real usage patterns
- Comprehensive coverage of all feature combinations
- Performance benchmark validation
- Data consistency across service restarts

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `supabase/seed.sql`
- `test/integration/real_environment_test.dart`
- `scripts/validate-real-env.sh`
- Test data management utilities

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 005, 006, 007 completed (All features integrated)
- [ ] All services running and functional
- [ ] Testing framework configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: false (requires all features complete)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented: Test data and validation scripts
- [ ] Tests written: Comprehensive integration test suite
- [ ] Performance validated: All benchmarks met
- [ ] Feature parity: Mock vs real service comparison passed
- [ ] Environment tested: Complete workflow validation
