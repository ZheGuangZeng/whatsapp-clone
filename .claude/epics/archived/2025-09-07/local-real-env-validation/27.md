# Task: Configure Docker Infrastructure for Real Services

## Description
Set up local Docker infrastructure with Supabase and LiveKit services running alongside existing Mock services. This creates the foundation for real service validation while maintaining current Mock-based development workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Supabase Docker stack (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime, API Gateway) running locally
- [ ] LiveKit server running in Docker container
- [ ] All services accessible via defined ports and endpoints
- [ ] Health check endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Services persist data across container restarts
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration updated for dual-mode support

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Extend existing `docker-compose.local.yml` with Supabase and LiveKit services
- Configure proper networking between services
- Set up environment variables for service endpoints
- Implement health checks for service validation

**Key considerations:**
- Port allocation to avoid conflicts with existing services
- Volume mounts for data persistence
- Service dependencies and startup ordering
- Resource allocation (CPU/memory limits)

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `docker-compose.local.yml`
- `.env.local`
- `scripts/verify-local-env.sh`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Docker Desktop installed and running
- [ ] Existing docker-compose configuration as baseline
- [ ] Supabase CLI available for configuration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: false (foundation for other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented: Docker Compose configuration updated
- [ ] Tests written: Health check validation script
- [ ] Documentation updated: Service startup instructions
- [ ] Services validated: All endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Environment tested: Container restart persistence verified
