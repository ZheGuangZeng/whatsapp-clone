## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 3-4
- Parallel: true (independent of auth/messaging)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented: Full meeting functionality
- [ ] Tests written: Meeting integration tests
- [ ] Performance tested: >95% call success rate
- [ ] UI tested: All meeting controls functional
- [ ] Connection tested: Reconnection logic working
