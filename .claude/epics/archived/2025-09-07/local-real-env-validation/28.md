# Task: Create Production-Identical Database Schema

## Description
Implement complete database schema in local Supabase instance matching production environment, including all tables, indexes, RLS policies, and triggers for messaging and meeting functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All user-related tables (users, profiles) created
- [ ] Messaging tables (chats, messages, participants) implemented
- [ ] Meeting functionality tables (meetings, meeting_participants) created
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured and tested
- [ ] Database indexes for performance optimization
- [ ] Triggers for automated data management
- [ ] Schema migration scripts created and validated

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Create Supabase migration files for all schema components
- Implement RLS policies matching production security requirements
- Add necessary indexes for query performance
- Set up triggers for automated timestamp management

**Key considerations:**
- RLS policy testing to prevent unauthorized access
- Foreign key constraints and referential integrity
- Performance optimization through proper indexing
- Migration rollback capabilities

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `supabase/migrations/`
- `supabase/schema.sql`
- Database initialization scripts

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (Docker Supabase running)
- [ ] Supabase CLI configured for local instance
- [ ] Production schema reference documentation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: false (required by service adapters)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented: Migration files created and applied
- [ ] Tests written: RLS policy validation tests
- [ ] Documentation updated: Schema documentation
- [ ] Schema validated: All tables and policies working
- [ ] Migration tested: Clean apply/rollback functionality
