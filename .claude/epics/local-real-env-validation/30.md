# Task: Implement Environment-Based Service Switching

## Description
Create environment configuration system in Flutter app that allows switching between Mock and real services through dependency injection, enabling seamless transition and testing of both service types.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Environment configuration system implemented
- [ ] Riverpod providers for both Mock and real services
- [ ] Service factory pattern for environment-based selection
- [ ] Single configuration change switches all services
- [ ] No code changes required to switch service modes
- [ ] Environment validation and error handling

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Create service factory that selects providers based on environment
- Update Riverpod dependency injection to support dual service modes
- Implement environment configuration loading at app startup
- Add validation to ensure selected services are available

**Key considerations:**
- Maintain existing Mock service functionality
- Clean dependency injection architecture
- Runtime service validation and fallback
- Clear error messages for configuration issues

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `lib/core/config/environment_config.dart`
- `lib/core/providers/service_providers.dart`
- `lib/main_local.dart`
- Service initialization code

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 completed (Real service adapters available)
- [ ] Existing Riverpod provider structure
- [ ] Environment configuration requirements defined

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: false (required by integration testing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented: Service switching system created
- [ ] Tests written: Environment switching tests
- [ ] Configuration tested: Both service modes functional
- [ ] Error handling: Clear messages for configuration errors
- [ ] Documentation: Service switching instructions updated
