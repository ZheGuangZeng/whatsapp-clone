# Task: Integrate Real Authentication Flow

## Description
Implement complete Supabase Auth integration in Flutter app, including user registration, login, password reset, and session management with proper error handling and security validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User registration with email/password working
- [ ] Login flow with session persistence
- [ ] Password reset functionality implemented
- [ ] JWT token management and refresh
- [ ] Auth state management with Riverpod
- [ ] Error handling for all auth scenarios
- [ ] Security validation (no auth bypass)

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Integrate Supabase Auth client in Flutter app
- Implement auth state management with Riverpod
- Add secure token storage and session handling
- Create auth UI components matching existing design

**Key considerations:**
- Secure token storage using secure storage package
- Proper session lifecycle management
- Error message consistency with Mock auth
- Auth state synchronization across app

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `lib/features/auth/`
- `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`
- Auth-related UI components
- Session management code

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 completed (Service switching available)
- [ ] Supabase Auth service configured
- [ ] Secure storage dependencies added

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: true (independent of messaging/meetings)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented: Full auth flow working
- [ ] Tests written: Auth integration tests
- [ ] Security tested: No authentication bypass
- [ ] Error handling: All auth errors handled properly
- [ ] Session management: Token refresh working
