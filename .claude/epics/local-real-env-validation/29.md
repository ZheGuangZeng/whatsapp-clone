# Task: Implement Real Service Adapters

## Description
Create real service adapter implementations for Supabase and LiveKit that implement the same interfaces as existing Mock services, enabling seamless switching between Mock and real services.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real Supabase adapter implementing messaging service interface
- [ ] Real LiveKit adapter implementing meeting service interface
- [ ] Real authentication adapter for Supabase Auth
- [ ] Service adapters pass all interface compliance tests
- [ ] Error handling matching Mock service behavior
- [ ] Connection management and retry logic implemented

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Extract interfaces from existing Mock service implementations
- Create concrete implementations connecting to real Supabase and LiveKit
- Implement identical error handling and response patterns
- Add connection pooling and retry mechanisms

**Key considerations:**
- Interface compatibility with existing Mock services
- Error message consistency for debugging
- Performance optimization for real service calls
- Connection lifecycle management

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `lib/core/services/real_supabase_service.dart`
- `lib/core/services/real_livekit_service.dart`  
- `lib/core/services/real_auth_service.dart`
- Service interface definitions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (Database schema available)
- [ ] Existing Mock service interfaces documented
- [ ] Supabase and LiveKit client libraries added

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 3-4
- Parallel: false (required by Flutter integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented: All service adapters created
- [ ] Tests written: Unit tests for each adapter
- [ ] Interface compliance: Adapters match Mock behavior
- [ ] Error handling: Consistent error responses
- [ ] Performance tested: Response times within limits
