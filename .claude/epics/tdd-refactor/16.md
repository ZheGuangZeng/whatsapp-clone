# Task: Meetings Core TDD

## Overview
Build the core Meetings functionality using TDD methodology, including domain models and LiveKit SDK integration for video/audio communication.

## Context
Meetings module was moved to .backup/ due to compilation errors. Rebuild core functionality with strict TDD approach focusing on LiveKit integration and meeting management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete meeting domain models with validation
- [ ] LiveKit service abstraction layer implemented
- [ ] Audio/video control use cases with tests
- [ ] 40+ test cases covering meeting lifecycle
- [ ] Mock LiveKit integration for testing

## Technical Approach

### Day 1: Meeting Domain TDD
**Entity Design**:
- Meeting entity: lifecycle states, participant limits, settings
- MeetingParticipant: roles, permissions, audio/video status
- MeetingState: state machine for meeting phases
- MeetingSettings: configuration and access control

**Use Cases**:
- CreateMeetingUseCase: validation, room creation, initial setup
- JoinMeetingUseCase: participant validation, permission checks
- LeaveMeetingUseCase: cleanup, state updates, notifications
- EndMeetingUseCase: meeting termination, resource cleanup

### Day 2: LiveKit Integration TDD
**Service Abstraction**:
- ILiveKitService interface defining all operations
- LiveKitServiceImpl with actual SDK integration
- Mock implementation for unit testing
- Error handling and connection management

**Media Control**:
- Audio control (mute/unmute) with state management
- Video control (camera on/off) with preview handling
- Participant management (add/remove/update)
- Room management (create/join/leave/destroy)

## Success Metrics
- Domain entities: 4 complete with state machines
- Use cases: 8 with comprehensive validation
- Service interfaces: 1 complete abstraction layer
- Test cases: 40+ covering all scenarios
- Mock coverage: 100% for LiveKit operations

## Dependencies
- Auth module completion (for user context)
- LiveKit Flutter SDK compatibility
- Network connectivity for integration testing
- Audio/video permissions on test devices

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All meeting entities implemented with validation
- [ ] Meeting lifecycle use cases complete
- [ ] LiveKit service abstraction functional
- [ ] Audio/video controls working in tests
- [ ] Mock service covers all operations
- [ ] Unit tests achieve â‰¥90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests with LiveKit successful
- [ ] Error scenarios properly handled

## Estimated Effort: 16 hours (2 days)
- Domain models: 8 hours
- LiveKit integration: 8 hoursupdated: 2025-09-06T15:03:06Z
