# Task: Meetings Complete

## Overview
Complete the Meetings module with UI integration, real-time synchronization, participant management, and comprehensive end-to-end testing.

## Context
Building upon the core meetings and LiveKit integration, implement the full meeting experience with UI components and real-time synchronization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete meeting UI rebuilt and integrated
- [ ] Real-time participant synchronization working
- [ ] Audio/video controls functional in UI
- [ ] 60+ test cases covering all layers
- [ ] End-to-end meeting functionality verified

## Technical Approach

### Day 1: Data Layer and State Management
**Meeting Models**:
- MeetingModel with JSON serialization for Supabase
- ParticipantModel with real-time status updates
- Meeting state persistence and recovery
- Offline meeting data caching

**State Management**:
- MeetingNotifier with Riverpod integration
- Real-time participant list synchronization
- Meeting state broadcasting and receiving
- Error state handling and user feedback

### Day 2: UI Components TDD
**Meeting UI Components**:
- MeetingLobbyPage: pre-meeting setup and validation
- MeetingRoomPage: main meeting interface
- ParticipantTile: video rendering and controls
- MeetingControls: audio/video/screen sharing buttons

**Real-time Integration**:
- LiveKit room connection and management
- Participant join/leave event handling
- Audio/video stream management
- Network quality monitoring and adaptation

### Day 3: Integration and Testing
**End-to-End Testing**:
- Complete meeting creation and joining flow
- Multi-participant meeting scenarios
- Audio/video control testing
- Network interruption and recovery testing
- Performance testing with multiple participants

**Edge Case Testing**:
- Meeting capacity limits
- Permission and access control
- Device capability handling
- Error recovery scenarios

## Success Metrics
- UI components: 8 rebuilt with integration tests
- State management: Complete Riverpod integration
- Real-time features: Participant sync and media streaming
- Test cases: 60+ covering all scenarios
- Performance: Stable with 4+ participants

## Dependencies
- Meetings core functionality completed
- LiveKit service integration tested
- UI patterns from existing components
- Device capabilities for audio/video testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All meeting UI components rebuilt
- [ ] Real-time participant synchronization functional
- [ ] Audio/video controls working properly
- [ ] Meeting lifecycle flows complete
- [ ] Integration tests covering critical paths
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Multi-device testing completed
- [ ] Code review approved

## Estimated Effort: 24 hours (3 days)
- Data layer and state: 8 hours
- UI components: 8 hours
- Integration and testing: 8 hoursupdated: 2025-09-06T15:03:06Z
