# Task: Auth TDD Repair

## Overview
Fix all 37 compilation errors in the Auth module using strict TDD methodology while maintaining existing authentication functionality.

## Context
Auth module currently has 37 compilation errors blocking the build process. This is the highest priority task as it unblocks integration testing for other modules.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 37 compilation errors resolved
- [ ] All existing auth functionality maintained
- [ ] Test coverage ≥80% for auth module
- [ ] 20+ test cases implemented using TDD approach
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks pass 100%

## Technical Approach

### TDD Red Phase (Day 1 Morning)
- Analyze each of the 37 compilation errors
- Write comprehensive failing tests for existing auth functionality
- Create test cases for edge cases and error scenarios
- Establish mock infrastructure for Supabase and SecureStorage

### TDD Green Phase (Day 1 Afternoon - Day 2 Morning)  
- Fix UseCase constructor issues
- Resolve IOSAccessibility import errors
- Fix AuthProviders constants problems
- Repair AuthState factory constructors
- Implement minimal code to pass all tests

### TDD Refactor Phase (Day 2 Afternoon)
- Improve code quality and structure
- Remove code duplication
- Ensure Clean Architecture compliance
- Optimize performance while maintaining tests

## Success Metrics
- Error count: 37 → 0
- Test coverage: Current% → 80%+
- Test suite: 0 → 20+ passing tests
- Build time: Should remain <5 minutes

## Dependencies
- Core architecture must remain stable
- Result pattern infrastructure available
- Pre-commit hooks functional
- Development environment configured

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Zero compilation errors in auth module
- [ ] All tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] Code coverage ≥80%
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks pass
- [ ] Manual authentication flow testing complete
- [ ] Documentation updated for any API changes

## Estimated Effort: 16 hours (2 days)
- Analysis and test setup: 4 hours
- TDD error fixing: 8 hours  
- Refactoring and validation: 4 hoursupdated: 2025-09-06T15:03:06Z
