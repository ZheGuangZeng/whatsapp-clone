# Epic: TDD Refactor

## Overview

Transform WhatsApp clone from 85 compilation errors to production-ready codebase using strict TDD methodology. Repair Auth module (37 errors) and rebuild Chat/Meetings/FileStorage modules from scratch using red-green-refactor cycles, achieving 0 errors and 80%+ test coverage.

## Architecture Decisions

- **TDD-First Development**: 100% red-green-refactor cycle for all code changes
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain strict data/domain/presentation layer separation
- **Result Pattern**: Continue using Success/ResultFailure for type-safe error handling
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks block any code that breaks compilation or tests
- **Test Strategy**: Unit (70%) + Integration (20%) + E2E (10%) testing pyramid
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock all external dependencies (Supabase, LiveKit) for unit tests

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **State Management**: Continue with Riverpod for all modules
- **UI Patterns**: Leverage existing core UI components, rebuild broken widgets
- **Test Coverage**: ≥80% coverage for all presentation layer components
- **Flutter 3.x**: Maintain compatibility with current Flutter/Dart versions

### Backend Services  
- **Supabase Integration**: Maintain existing auth/database/storage/realtime connections
- **LiveKit Integration**: Rebuild meetings module with current LiveKit Flutter SDK
- **API Layer**: Implement repository pattern consistently across all modules
- **Error Handling**: Use Result pattern throughout all service layers

### Infrastructure
- **Build Pipeline**: Maintain <5 minute CI/CD with 100% success rate
- **Quality Metrics**: Automated test coverage reporting and error tracking  
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Enforce compilation success and test passing
- **Environment Config**: Leverage existing .env setup for different environments

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Repair Phase** (Days 1-2): Fix Auth module using TDD approach on existing code
2. **Rebuild Phase 1** (Days 3-6): Chat module from scratch with TDD
3. **Rebuild Phase 2** (Days 7-11): Meetings module from scratch with TDD  
4. **Rebuild Phase 3** (Days 12-14): FileStorage module from scratch with TDD

### Risk Mitigation
- **Time Boxing**: Strict 2/4/5/3 day phases with daily progress checkpoints
- **Scope Protection**: No new features, maintain exact functionality parity
- **Quality Gates**: Cannot proceed to next phase without 100% test passing
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep .backup/ modules until replacements are verified

### Testing Approach
- **TDD Red Phase**: Write comprehensive failing tests first
- **TDD Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests  
- **TDD Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage
- **Integration Testing**: Test module interactions and external service integration

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories (targeting ≤10 total tasks):

- [ ] **Auth TDD Repair**: Fix 37 compilation errors using TDD methodology (Days 1-2)
- [ ] **Chat Domain TDD**: Build entities, use cases, repositories with tests (Day 3)
- [ ] **Chat Data & Presentation**: Complete chat module with UI integration (Days 4-6) 
- [ ] **Meetings Core TDD**: Domain models and LiveKit integration (Days 7-8)
- [ ] **Meetings Complete**: UI, real-time sync, participant management (Days 9-11)
- [ ] **FileStorage TDD**: Domain, Supabase Storage integration, UI (Days 12-14)
- [ ] **Final Validation**: Complete test suite, performance benchmarks, documentation

## Dependencies

### External Service Dependencies
- **Supabase Services**: Database schema stability, API compatibility
- **LiveKit SDK**: Flutter SDK version compatibility and API stability
- **Flutter/Dart**: No version updates during 14-day sprint

### Internal Team Dependencies  
- **TDD Expertise**: Single developer must maintain strict TDD discipline
- **Test Infrastructure**: Pre-commit hooks and testing framework must remain stable
- **Core Architecture**: lib/core/ foundation must remain stable (currently 0 errors)

### Prerequisite Work
- **Environment Setup**: Development environment already configured
- **Backup Strategy**: Broken modules already moved to .backup/
- **Success Example**: Messaging system already demonstrates TDD approach (25/25 tests)

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Quantitative Benchmarks
- **Error Count**: 85 → 0 compilation errors (100% reduction)
- **Test Coverage**: 15% → 80%+ (5x improvement)  
- **Test Suite Size**: 200+ passing tests across all modules
- **Build Performance**: <5 minutes CI/CD pipeline execution
- **App Performance**: <3s cold start, <200ms page transitions

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit**: 100% pass rate for compilation and test execution
- **Architecture**: 100% Clean Architecture compliance validation
- **Code Quality**: <10 cyclomatic complexity, consistent naming patterns
- **Integration**: All external service connections functional

### Module-Specific Targets
- **Auth Module**: 37→0 errors, 20+ tests, maintain existing functionality
- **Chat Module**: Complete rebuild, 80+ tests, real-time messaging
- **Meetings Module**: LiveKit integration, 60+ tests, video/audio controls
- **FileStorage Module**: Supabase Storage, 40+ tests, file management

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline: 14 Days
- **Auth Repair**: 2 days (high complexity due to existing code constraints)
- **Chat Rebuild**: 4 days (medium complexity, clean slate TDD)
- **Meetings Rebuild**: 5 days (high complexity due to LiveKit integration)
- **FileStorage Rebuild**: 3 days (low complexity, straightforward CRUD)

### Resource Requirements
- **Single Developer**: Expert-level TDD and Flutter/Dart knowledge
- **Development Environment**: Fully configured with emulators/simulators
- **External Services**: Stable Supabase and LiveKit account access

### Critical Path Items
- **Auth Module Completion**: Blocks integration testing of other modules
- **TDD Infrastructure**: Must remain functional throughout project
- **External API Stability**: Supabase and LiveKit cannot change during sprint

This epic provides a technically sound, achievable plan to transform the codebase using proven TDD methodology while minimizing risk and maintaining strict quality standards.updated: 2025-09-06T15:03:24Z
