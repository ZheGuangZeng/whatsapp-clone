# Task 5: Monitoring & Observability

## Overview
Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability system with custom error tracking, performance metrics collection, intelligent alerting, and log aggregation for proactive production issue detection and resolution.

## Context
No production monitoring exists. Requires custom-built solution to minimize costs while providing enterprise-grade observability for production issue detection within 5 minutes and response within 15 minutes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Custom error tracking with 100% crash capture
- [ ] Real-time performance metrics collection and dashboards
- [ ] Intelligent alert system with <5 minutes detection time
- [ ] Log aggregation system with searchable interface
- [ ] User analytics and usage tracking implementation
- [ ] Server health monitoring with uptime tracking
- [ ] <15 minutes mean time to first response for critical alerts
- [ ] Custom monitoring solution deployment and testing

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Custom Error Tracking System
- **Crash Reporting**: Flutter crash handler with detailed stack traces
- **Error Categorization**: Automatic error classification and deduplication
- **Context Capture**: Device info, user actions, app state at crash time
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant alerts for critical errors

### Phase 2: Performance Metrics Collection
- **Flutter Performance**: App startup, memory usage, frame rate tracking
- **Network Metrics**: API response times, network latency, failure rates
- **User Experience**: Screen load times, user interaction response times
- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific metrics (message delivery, call quality)

### Phase 3: Alert Configuration System
- **Alert Rules**: Configurable thresholds for various metrics
- **Notification Channels**: Email, Slack, SMS for different alert severities
- **Alert Suppression**: Intelligent alert grouping to prevent spam
- **Escalation Policies**: Automatic escalation for unacknowledged alerts

### Phase 4: Log Aggregation and Analysis
- **Log Collection**: Centralized logging from app and backend services
- **Log Processing**: Structured logging with searchable fields
- **Log Analysis**: Pattern detection and anomaly identification
- **Log Retention**: Configurable retention policies for storage optimization

### Phase 5: Dashboards and Visualization
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live metrics visualization for operations team
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend analysis and capacity planning dashboards
- **User Analytics**: User behavior and usage pattern analysis
- **Performance Dashboards**: Application and infrastructure performance views

## Success Metrics
- **Error Detection**: <5 minutes mean time to detection for critical issues
- **Alert Response**: <15 minutes mean time to first response
- **Crash Capture**: 100% crash capture rate with detailed context
- **Uptime Monitoring**: â‰¥99.5% measured system availability
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time metrics for all KPIs
- **Log Coverage**: 100% of critical application events logged

## Custom Monitoring Components

### Flutter Error Tracking
- **Error Handler**: Custom Flutter error zone and crash handler
- **Context Collection**: User session, device info, app version tracking
- **Stack Trace Analysis**: Detailed stack trace with source mapping
- **Error Deduplication**: Smart grouping of similar errors

### Performance Monitoring
- **Startup Tracking**: App launch time measurement and reporting
- **Memory Monitoring**: Memory usage patterns and leak detection
- **Network Monitoring**: API call performance and failure tracking
- **UI Performance**: Frame rate and render time measurement

### Backend Monitoring
- **API Monitoring**: Response time, error rate, and throughput tracking
- **Database Monitoring**: Query performance and connection pool status
- **LiveKit Integration**: Video/audio quality and connection monitoring
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and disk usage tracking

## Testing Requirements
- **Monitoring Testing**: Verify all monitoring components capture events
- **Alert Testing**: Test alert rules and notification delivery
- **Dashboard Testing**: Validate real-time data display and accuracy
- **Load Testing**: Ensure monitoring system handles production scale
- **Failover Testing**: Test monitoring system resilience and redundancy

## Alert Configuration
- **Critical Alerts**: App crashes, API downtime, security breaches
- **Warning Alerts**: Performance degradation, high error rates
- **Info Alerts**: Deployment notifications, capacity warnings
- **Escalation**: Automatic escalation for unacknowledged critical alerts

## Dependencies
- **Task 4 Completion**: Production infrastructure required for monitoring deployment
- **Flutter Framework**: Integration with Flutter performance and error APIs
- **Backend Services**: Supabase and LiveKit monitoring integration
- **Notification Services**: Email/SMS services for alert delivery

## Risk Mitigation
- **Monitoring Resilience**: Monitor the monitoring system itself
- **Alert Fatigue**: Intelligent alert grouping and suppression
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure monitoring complies with privacy regulations
- **Performance Impact**: Minimize monitoring overhead on app performance

## Cost Optimization
- **Self-Built Solution**: Custom implementation to minimize licensing costs
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized log storage and data retention policies
- **Smart Sampling**: Sample non-critical metrics to reduce data volume
- **Open Source Tools**: Leverage open source components where possible

## Deployment Strategy
- **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy monitoring components incrementally
- **A/B Testing**: Test monitoring impact on app performance
- **Backup Systems**: Ensure monitoring doesn't become single point of failure
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive monitoring system documentation

## Effort Estimation: 1 Day (8 hours)
- **Morning**: Error tracking and performance metrics implementation
- **Afternoon**: Alert configuration, dashboard creation, and system testing
