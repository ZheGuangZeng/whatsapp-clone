# Task 2: Performance Optimization Bundle

## Overview
Systematically optimize application performance to meet production benchmarks: <3 second cold start, <200ms UI navigation, <500ms message latency, and <200MB baseline memory usage through profiling, optimization, and comprehensive testing.

## Context
Current performance is unmeasured and likely suboptimal for production use. App store guidelines and user experience requirements demand specific performance thresholds that must be validated and achieved before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] App cold start time <3 seconds on iPhone 12/Samsung Galaxy S21
- [ ] UI page navigation transitions <200ms average
- [ ] Message send/receive latency <500ms end-to-end
- [ ] Memory usage <200MB baseline, <500MB peak during normal operations  
- [ ] File upload chunking implemented for files >10MB
- [ ] Performance metrics collection and monitoring implemented
- [ ] Network request optimization and caching layer active
- [ ] UI rendering optimizations reducing jank and frame drops

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Performance Baseline and Profiling
- **Startup Profiling**: Use Flutter DevTools to identify startup bottlenecks
