# Task: Testing & Quality Assurance

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing strategy with Test-Driven Development (TDD) achieving 80%+ code coverage. Includes unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, and security testing to ensure production readiness and quality gates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 80%+ automated test coverage across all features
- [ ] Unit test suite for all business logic components
- [ ] Integration tests for API and database interactions
- [ ] Widget tests for all UI components
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Performance tests for latency and throughput requirements
- [ ] Load tests for concurrent user scenarios (10,000 users)
- [ ] Security tests for authentication and data protection
- [ ] Accessibility tests for compliance standards
- [ ] Cross-platform tests for iOS and Android consistency
- [ ] Regression test suite for continuous integration
- [ ] Test automation in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test reporting dashboard with metrics
- [ ] Bug tracking and resolution workflow
- [ ] Quality gate enforcement for deployments

## Technical Approach
- Implement TDD methodology with test-first development
- Use Flutter test framework with mockito for unit testing
- Create integration test environment with test databases
- Design performance testing with realistic load scenarios
- Implement security testing with automated vulnerability scanning
- Use continuous testing in CI/CD pipeline with quality gates

## Testing Requirements
- Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- Test environment provisioning and data management
- Performance baseline establishment and monitoring
- Security vulnerability scanning and reporting
- Cross-platform test execution on real devices
- Test result analysis and quality metrics tracking

## Dependencies
- All application features implemented and ready for testing
- Test environment infrastructure provisioning
- CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated testing
- Performance testing tools and infrastructure setup
