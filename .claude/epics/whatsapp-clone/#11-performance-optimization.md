## Description
Implement comprehensive performance optimization focusing on China network conditions, latency reduction, memory efficiency, and battery optimization. Includes caching strategies, network optimization, and resource management for optimal user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sub-500ms message latency achieved for Asia-Pacific regions
- [ ] Sub-150ms audio/video latency in meetings
- [ ] Cold start time <3 seconds on mid-range devices
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for extended meeting sessions
- [ ] Battery optimization for mobile device longevity
- [ ] Network retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Intelligent caching with automatic cache invalidation
- [ ] Image and video compression optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization with proper indexing
- [ ] CDN optimization for China network conditions
- [ ] Connection pooling and resource reuse
- [ ] Background task optimization for minimal impact
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Benchmark testing for all performance metrics
- [ ] Load testing validation for optimization improvements

## Technical Approach
- Implement intelligent caching layers for frequently accessed data
- Optimize network requests with connection reuse and compression
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms for performance-critical code
- Implement lazy loading and virtualization for large data sets
- Create network condition adaptation with quality adjustment
- Design background processing with minimal battery impact

## Testing Requirements
- Performance benchmarking with before/after metrics
- Network condition simulation tests (poor connectivity)
- Memory profiling and leak detection
- Battery usage testing on real devices
- Load testing for optimized components
- Regression testing to ensure optimizations don't break functionality

## Dependencies
