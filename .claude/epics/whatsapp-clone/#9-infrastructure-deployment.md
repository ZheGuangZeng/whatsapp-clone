# Task: Infrastructure & Deployment

## Description
Implement multi-region deployment infrastructure with container orchestration, auto-scaling, monitoring, and China network optimization. Includes production-ready deployment with 99.5% uptime requirements and geographic load balancing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Docker containerization for all services
- [ ] Kubernetes orchestration with Helm charts
- [ ] Multi-region deployment (Japan/Singapore primary)
- [ ] Geographic load balancing for China users
- [ ] Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory and meeting load
- [ ] Database read replicas with connection pooling
- [ ] CDN configuration with Asia-Pacific optimization
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates with automatic renewal
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics
- [ ] Alerting system for service health and performance
- [ ] Log aggregation and centralized logging
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Pulumi)
- [ ] 99.5% uptime achievement in production

## Technical Approach
- Use Kubernetes for container orchestration with auto-scaling
- Implement geographic routing with DNS-based load balancing
- Create monitoring stack with Prometheus/Grafana
- Design backup strategy with automated recovery testing
- Use Infrastructure as Code for reproducible deployments
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero downtime

## Testing Requirements
- Infrastructure tests for deployment automation
- Load tests for auto-scaling validation
- Disaster recovery tests with actual failover scenarios
- Security tests for network and container vulnerabilities
- Performance tests for multi-region latency
- Monitoring tests for alert accuracy and timing

## Dependencies
- All application services ready for production deployment
- Cloud provider accounts and networking setup
- Domain registration and DNS configuration
- SSL certificate provisioning
