- **Agent-1**: Issue #2 Authentication System - ✅ Completed (2025-09-05T14:39:36Z)
- **Agent-2**: Issue #3 Messaging Engine - 🔄 Starting (dependency resolved)
- **Agent-3**: Issue #4 File Storage System - 🔄 Starting (dependency resolved)

## Phase 1 Ready Tasks (Critical Path)
- **Issue #2**: Authentication & User Management System - 45h
  - Status: Foundation complete, ready for implementation
  - Streams: Supabase Auth, User Management, Flutter Integration
  - Files: `lib/features/auth/`, `lib/core/services/`

## Phase 2 Active Tasks (Auth Complete)
- **Issue #3**: Real-time Messaging Engine - 55h ✅ READY
- **Issue #4**: File Storage & Sharing System - 40h ✅ READY  
- **Issue #8**: Mobile App Development - 55h (waiting for #3, #4)

## Phase 3+ Tasks (Later Dependencies)
- **Issue #5**: LiveKit Meeting Integration - 60h (depends on #2, #3)
- **Issue #6**: Advanced Meeting Features - 50h (depends on #5)

## Completed Foundation Work
- ✅ Flutter project structure created
- ✅ All dependencies configured and resolved
- ✅ Clean Architecture directories established  
- ✅ Core providers and utilities implemented
- ✅ Testing framework set up (14 tests passing)
- ✅ Git repository with proper commit history

## Next Actions
1. **Launch Agent-1**: Authentication System implementation (can start immediately)
2. **Monitor Progress**: Track auth completion to unlock messaging and file storage
3. **Prepare Phase 2**: Ready messaging and file storage agents for parallel launch
4. **Scale Up**: Plan for 3-4 parallel agents once foundation tasks complete

## Critical Path Status
- **Foundation**: ✅ Complete (Flutter, dependencies, architecture)
- **Authentication**: 🔄 Ready to start (critical path blocker)
- **Messaging**: ⏳ Waiting for authentication
- **Meetings**: ⏳ Waiting for authentication + messaging

## Resource Allocation
- **Current**: 1 agent (authentication)
- **Planned**: Scale to 4 agents by end of Phase 1
- **Maximum**: 6 agents during Phase 2-3 parallel execution
