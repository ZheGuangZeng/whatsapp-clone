# Epic: WhatsApp Clone with Advanced Meeting Capabilities

## Overview

This epic implements a comprehensive WhatsApp-style messaging platform with professional-grade video conferencing capabilities, specifically designed for Chinese-speaking communities worldwide. The solution combines real-time messaging (Supabase) with large-scale meetings (LiveKit) using Flutter/Riverpod architecture, supporting 50-100 participant meetings with advanced collaboration features.

**Core Technical Challenge**: Integrate enterprise-grade meeting functionality (breakout rooms, recording, screen sharing, collaborative whiteboard) into a consumer messaging app while maintaining sub-500ms latency for Chinese users accessing overseas infrastructure.

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack Rationale
- **Flutter + Riverpod**: Cross-platform with modern state management, reducing development time by 60% vs native apps
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL-based real-time capabilities eliminate need for custom WebSocket infrastructure
- **LiveKit**: Open-source WebRTC solution provides self-hosting flexibility and large meeting support vs Agora/Twilio
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven design enables parallel development and high test coverage (80%+)

### Infrastructure Strategy
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Japan/Singapore primary regions to serve Chinese users with <150ms latency
- **Progressive Scaling**: Local dev → Supabase Cloud → Self-hosted to optimize costs during growth phases
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery for media files with Asia-Pacific optimization
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Microservices architecture supporting 10x user growth without architectural changes

### Data Architecture
- **Event-Driven Messaging**: Supabase Realtime for sub-500ms message delivery
- **Meeting State Management**: LiveKit rooms with persistent metadata in PostgreSQL
- **File Storage Strategy**: Tiered storage (hot/cold) for cost optimization with 100MB per file limit
- **Analytics Pipeline**: Real-time metrics collection for 99.5% availability monitoring

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components (Flutter/Riverpod)

**Core UI Architecture:**
- **Authentication Flow**: Phone/email registration with Supabase Auth integration
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time message lists with optimistic updates and offline queuing
- **Meeting UI**: LiveKit video grid with dynamic layout for 50-100 participants
- **Community Management**: Group administration with role-based permissions
- **File Sharing**: Progressive upload with background processing and thumbnails

**State Management Pattern:**
- **Riverpod Providers**: Feature-based providers with dependency injection
- **Real-time Sync**: Stream providers for message/meeting state synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Either pattern for consistent error propagation and user feedback
- **Caching Strategy**: Local caching with automatic cache invalidation

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Lazy Loading**: Message pagination and participant loading for memory efficiency
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic compression and format conversion
- **Network Resilience**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for China network conditions

### Backend Services (Supabase + LiveKit)

**Supabase Configuration:**
- **Database Schema**: Normalized tables with Row Level Security for multi-tenant isolation
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Optimized PostgreSQL triggers for message broadcasting

- **File Storage**: Bucket policies with automatic cleanup for temporary files
- **Edge Functions**: Custom business logic for meeting orchestration and notifications

**LiveKit Integration:**
- **Room Management**: Dynamic room creation with participant capacity limits
- **Recording Pipeline**: Automated cloud recording with S3/OSS storage integration
- **Screen Sharing**: Application window capture with permission management
- **Breakout Rooms**: Sub-room creation with participant migration
- **Whiteboard Service**: Real-time collaborative canvas with vector synchronization

**API Design:**
- **REST Endpoints**: Standard CRUD operations with OpenAPI documentation
- **WebSocket Streams**: Real-time updates for messaging and meeting events
- **Webhook Processing**: External service integration for push notifications
