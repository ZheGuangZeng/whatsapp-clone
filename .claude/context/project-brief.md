# Project Brief

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: WhatsApp Clone with Advanced Meeting Capabilities  
**Code Name**: MeetChat  
**Duration**: 10 weeks (September 2025 - November 2025)  
**Methodology**: CCPM (Claude Code Project Management)  
**Development Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## What It Does

### Core Purpose
This project creates a messaging application that merges the user-friendly experience of WhatsApp with the professional meeting capabilities of Zoom, specifically tailored for Chinese-speaking communities worldwide.

### Primary Functions
1. **Instant Messaging**: Real-time text messaging with multimedia support
2. **Large-Scale Meetings**: Video/audio conferences supporting 50-100 participants
3. **Community Management**: Group chat and discussion management tools
4. **Professional Meeting Features**: Screen sharing, recording, breakout rooms
5. **Cross-Platform Access**: Native mobile apps for iOS and Android

### Key Differentiators
- **Meeting-First Design**: Unlike other chat apps that add meetings as an afterthought
- **Large Meeting Support**: Professional-grade conferences for community events
- **China-Optimized Infrastructure**: Reliable access for Chinese users via overseas servers
- **Community-Focused**: Built specifically for interest groups and communities

## Why It Exists

### Market Gap
Existing solutions fail to adequately serve Chinese-speaking communities:

- **WeChat/WeCom**: Poor performance with 20+ participants, limited professional features
- **Zoom**: Blocked or unreliable in China, lacks social/community features  
- **DingTalk**: Enterprise-focused, not suitable for casual communities
- **Discord**: Gaming-oriented, complex interface, poor Chinese localization

### Target Problem
Community organizers struggle to manage both daily communication and large meeting events with a single, reliable tool that works well for Chinese users.

### Opportunity Size
- **Primary Market**: 50M users in Chinese interest communities globally
- **Secondary Market**: Remote work teams and cross-border collaboration
- **Revenue Potential**: $50M+ ARR at scale through premium features

## Success Criteria

### User Success Metrics
- **10,000+ Active Users** in first year
- **100+ Active Communities** using the platform regularly
- **>95% Meeting Success Rate** for 50+ participant meetings
- **4.5+ App Store Rating** across iOS and Android

### Technical Success Metrics
- **<5 Second Meeting Join Time** from tap to video
- **<150ms Audio/Video Latency** in Asia-Pacific region
- **99.5+ Uptime** for core messaging and meeting services
- **80%+ Test Coverage** across all features

### Business Success Metrics
- **40% 7-Day User Retention** rate
- **25% 30-Day User Retention** rate
- **$50 LTV per User** within 12 months
- **Net Promoter Score >50** from active users

2. **Prove Technical Scalability**: Successfully host 10+ concurrent large meetings
3. **Establish Community Adoption**: 20+ communities using platform for regular events
4. **Demonstrate Reliability**: 99%+ uptime for core services

### Medium-Term Goals (6-12 months)
1. **Scale User Base**: Grow to 10,000+ monthly active users
2. **Feature Completeness**: Add advanced meeting features and community tools
3. **Market Expansion**: Expand beyond initial Chinese market to global Chinese diaspora
4. **Revenue Foundation**: Establish premium features and business model

### Long-Term Vision (1-2 years)

4. **Sustainable Business**: Achieve profitability with diverse revenue streams

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **1 Full-Stack Developer** (Flutter + Backend)
- **Access to Claude Code PM System** for AI-assisted development
- **Part-time DevOps Support** for infrastructure management
- **Part-time QA/Testing Support** for quality assurance

### Infrastructure
- **Supabase Cloud**: Database, auth, real-time, storage services
- **LiveKit Cloud/Self-hosted**: Video conferencing infrastructure  
- **CDN Services**: Global content delivery (focus on Asia-Pacific)
- **Monitoring Tools**: Application performance and error tracking

### Budget Considerations
- **Development**: Primary cost is developer time (10 weeks)
- **Infrastructure**: Supabase + LiveKit operational costs
- **App Store**: iOS/Android app store developer accounts
- **Domain/SSL**: Basic operational requirements

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
1. **LiveKit Integration Complexity**: Large meeting functionality is core differentiator
2. **China Network Performance**: Overseas server latency and reliability
3. **Scalability Unknowns**: Unproven handling of concurrent large meetings

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **User Adoption**: Competition from established platforms
2. **Technical Debt**: Aggressive 10-week timeline may compromise quality
3. **Regulatory Changes**: Chinese internet policy changes

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Testing**: Each phase includes thorough testing and validation
- **CCPM Methodology**: Spec-driven development ensures traceability and quality
- **Multi-Environment Strategy**: Local → Cloud → Self-hosted deployment options

## Stakeholder Alignment

### Primary Stakeholders
