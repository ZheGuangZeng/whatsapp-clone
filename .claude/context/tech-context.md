1. **Real-time**: PostgreSQL-based real-time is more reliable
2. **SQL**: Full SQL capabilities vs NoSQL limitations
3. **Self-hosting**: Option to migrate to self-hosted infrastructure
4. **Cost**: More predictable pricing model

### Why LiveKit over Agora/Twilio?
1. **Open Source**: Can self-host for better control
2. **WebRTC**: Direct peer-to-peer when possible
3. **Scalability**: Designed for large meetings (50-100+ participants)
4. **Features**: Built-in screen sharing, recording, breakout rooms

## Security Considerations
