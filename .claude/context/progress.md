## Outstanding Changes

**Configuration Files:**
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with comprehensive development rules
- Created detailed PRD with meeting-focused requirements
- Generated complete development guide with CCPM integration

**Documentation Updates:**
- Project development guide aligned with official CCMP installation method
- Context documentation framework established
- Technical stack decisions documented

## Recent Decisions Made

### Technical Stack Finalized
- **Frontend**: Flutter (iOS/Android priority)
- **Backend**: Supabase (real-time database, auth, storage)
- **State Management**: Riverpod (chosen over Bloc for simplicity and modern approach)
- **Video/Audio**: LiveKit for 50-100 person meetings
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + CCPM workflow
- **Testing**: TDD with test-runner sub-agent

### Product Scope Clarified
- **Core Focus**: WhatsApp-style messaging + Zoom-like meetings
- **Target Users**: Chinese-speaking communities, all age groups
- **Priority Features**: Large meetings (50-100 people), screen sharing, recording, breakout rooms
- **Deferred Features**: End-to-end encryption, social media features, business tools

### Infrastructure Decisions
- **Deployment**: Japan/Singapore servers (not China mainland)
- **Scale Target**: 10,000+ users in first year
- **Development Method**: 10-week timeline with CCPM parallel execution

## Blocked Items

**None** - Epic completed successfully. Ready for production deployment.
