# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Phase: Initial Setup & Planning**

### ✅ Completed Work
- **CCPM System Setup**: Fully initialized Claude Code Project Management system
- **PRD Creation**: Comprehensive Product Requirements Document created (`.claude/prds/whatsapp-clone.md`)
- **Development Guide**: Complete 25,000+ word implementation guide (`WHATSAPP_CLONE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`)
- **Project Rules**: Enhanced CLAUDE.md with project-specific development rules
- **Context Framework**: Initialized project context documentation system

### 🔄 Current Work Stream
- **Context Creation**: Documenting current project state and establishing baseline
- **Ready for Technical Planning**: PRD is complete and ready for parsing into technical epic

### 📋 Immediate Next Steps (Next 1-2 hours)
1. Complete context documentation creation
2. Parse PRD into technical implementation plan: `/pm:prd-parse whatsapp-clone`
3. Decompose Epic into GitHub Issues: `/pm:epic-oneshot whatsapp-clone`
4. Initialize Flutter project structure
5. Set up Supabase development environment

### 🎯 Current Sprint Goals (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Environment Setup**: Complete local dev, cloud, and self-hosted testing environments
2. **Core Architecture**: Implement Clean Architecture with Riverpod state management
3. **Basic Chat**: 1-on-1 messaging with Supabase Realtime
4. **Authentication**: User registration and login system
5. **Initial Testing**: TDD setup with comprehensive test coverage

## Outstanding Changes

**Configuration Files:**
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with comprehensive development rules
- Created detailed PRD with meeting-focused requirements
- Generated complete development guide with CCPM integration

**Documentation Updates:**
- Project development guide aligned with official CCMP installation method
- Context documentation framework established
- Technical stack decisions documented

## Recent Decisions Made

### Technical Stack Finalized
- **Frontend**: Flutter (iOS/Android priority)
- **Backend**: Supabase (real-time database, auth, storage)
- **State Management**: Riverpod (chosen over Bloc for simplicity and modern approach)
- **Video/Audio**: LiveKit for 50-100 person meetings
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + CCPM workflow
- **Testing**: TDD with test-runner sub-agent

### Product Scope Clarified
- **Core Focus**: WhatsApp-style messaging + Zoom-like meetings
- **Target Users**: Chinese-speaking communities, all age groups
- **Priority Features**: Large meetings (50-100 people), screen sharing, recording, breakout rooms
- **Deferred Features**: End-to-end encryption, social media features, business tools

### Infrastructure Decisions
- **Deployment**: Japan/Singapore servers (not China mainland)
- **Scale Target**: 10,000+ users in first year
- **Development Method**: 10-week timeline with CCPM parallel execution

## Blocked Items

**None currently** - All prerequisites for development are in place.

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks (Medium)
- LiveKit integration complexity for large meetings
- China-to-overseas server latency issues
- Flutter + Supabase + LiveKit integration testing needs

### Project Risks (Low)
- First-time CCPM workflow adoption curve
- TDD discipline maintenance across all features
- Scope creep potential with meeting features

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Development Metrics
- **PRD Completion**: ✅ 100% (comprehensive 66-section document)
- **Architecture Planning**: 🔄 In Progress (ready for technical parsing)
- **Environment Setup**: ⏳ Pending (next immediate step)
- **Code Coverage Target**: 80%+ (not yet applicable)

### Product Metrics (Targets)
- **First Year Users**: 10,000+ active users
- **Meeting Success Rate**: >95% for 50+ person meetings
- **User Retention**: 40% (7-day), 25% (30-day)
- **Meeting Usage**: 60% of active users using meeting features

## Context Notes

This is a greenfield WhatsApp clone project with a specific focus on advanced meeting capabilities. The project uses the CCPM (Claude Code Project Management) methodology for spec-driven development with full traceability from PRD to production code.

**Unique Aspects:**
- Meeting-first approach (not just chat with meetings added)
- China market focus with overseas infrastructure
- CCPM workflow for AI-assisted parallel development
- Clean Architecture + TDD from day one
